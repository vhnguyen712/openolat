/**
 * Description:<br>
 * The XStreamHelper provides you with some methods to quickly save and restore
 * objects on disk using XML. This helper does the try/catch and writing and
 * reading from/to the disk.
 * <p>
 * Using xStream without configuration is not recommended. This persists the
 * class using the class name which makes it very difficult to refactor the
 * class at a later stage.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to have a private XStream instance in the manager of your
 * package. You can create such an instance using the createXStreamInstance()
 * method. Note that the XStream instance is threadsave, it is normally ok to
 * have one stream per manager. Now you can use field and attribute mappers to
 * define how the XML should look like. 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * private static final XStream mystream;
 * static {
 * 	mystream = XStreamHelper.createXStreamInstance();
 *  mystream.alias("user", UserImpl.class);
 *  mystream.alias("identity", IdentityImpl.class);
 *  mystream.alias("addr", AddressImpl.class);
 * }
 * ... 
 * XStreamHelper.writeObject(mystream, myfile, myIdentity);
 * ...
 * Identity ident = (Identity) XStreamHelper.readObject(mystream, myfile);
 * <code>
